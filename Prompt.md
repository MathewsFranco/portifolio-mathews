## NOTE FOR THE MODEL

**Use the existing project setup** (TanStack Router, not Next.js App Router). The project was scaffolded with Better-T-Stack and already has:
- TanStack Router for file-based routing
- Tailwind CSS configured
- shadcn/ui components available
- Biome for linting/formatting
- Bun as package manager

Adapt all file paths and routing patterns to match TanStack Router conventions (`/src/routes/` structure).

## COVER LETTER (USE THIS COPY)

**Opening:**
I craft seamless, consistent, and intuitive digital products where interaction meets visual design. With a strong appreciation for design and a user-first mindset, I enjoy turning complex ideas into effortless digital experiences. Beyond writing clean, efficient code, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to both the technical and strategic sides of a project.

**Poker Background:**
My background as a professional poker player has shaped my ability to analyze situations quickly, make data-driven decisions, and stay composed under pressure — traits that serve me well in fast-paced development teams.

**Beyond the Code:**
I'm a coffee enthusiast on a never-ending quest for the perfect brew, constantly experimenting with new methods and local roasts. Fitness keeps me active, from gym sessions to squash, skiing, and bouldering. I also love strategy games — whether it's a competitive board game night or an intense computer gaming session, I thrive on problem-solving and creative thinking. When I'm not gaming or on the move, I enjoy analyzing art, uncovering the hidden stories within each piece.

**Closing:**
Let's grab a cup of coffee and discuss how our goals and ambitions align!

---

### 6. GITHUB ACTIVITY SECTION

**Purpose**: Live proof of work. Self-updating, requires no maintenance.

**Data sources** (GitHub public API — no auth token needed):

- `GET /users/mathewsfranco` → public repo count

**Sub-components to build**:

#### Stats Bar
Four stat tiles in a row:
- Public Repos (from user endpoint)
- Recent Commits (count from push events)
- Pull Requests (from search endpoint)
- Total Stars (sum across all repos)

#### Recent Commits Panel
- List of 6 most recent public commits
- Each row: commit message (truncated with ellipsis) + short SHA badge + repo name + relative time (e.g. "3d ago")
- Loading skeleton while fetching
- Error state if API fails

#### Recent Pull Requests Panel
- List of 6 most recent PRs across all public repos
- Each row: state dot (merged = purple, open = green, closed = red) + PR title + repo name + PR number + relative time

- Filter out forks, keep only repos with descriptions
- Sort by a combination of stars + recency
- Show up to 4 cards
- Each card: repo name, description, language (with color dot), star count, last pushed relative time
- Link to GitHub repo on click

#### Contribution Graph
- 24-week heatmap built from event data
- 7 rows (Sun–Sat), weeks as columns
- 5 levels: 0 (empty), 1–4 (light to saturated green)
- Month labels above columns
- Tooltip on hover showing date + event count
- Horizontally scrollable on mobile

**Error handling**: If the GitHub API rate limit is hit (60 req/hour unauthenticated), show a friendly fallback message: "GitHub data temporarily unavailable — view my profile directly."

---

### 7. CONTACT SECTION

## THE 5 DESIGN VERSIONS

Build all 5 as separate theme variants. Each must differ in: color palette, typography pairing, layout personality, and animation style. The section content and structure remains identical across all versions — only the visual layer changes. Implement themes via a CSS variable system so switching between them is a single class change on the `<html>` element.

---

### VERSION 1 — "Terminal Green"
*Dark, technical, slightly retro. Like a beautiful developer tool.*

- **Background**: Near-black `#0a0c0b`
- **Surface**: `#111411`
- **Accent**: Phosphor green `#39ff14`
- **Text**: Off-white `#e8ede9`, muted `#5a6b5d`
- **Fonts**: `DM Mono` (headings, display) + `IBM Plex Sans` (body)
- **Personality**: Monospace aesthetic. Section headers prefixed with `//` or `>`. Tech badges look like CLI flags. Cursor blink animations.
- **Animations**: Fast, snappy. Typewriter effect on hero tagline. Grid lines as background texture.
- **Special**: Subtle scan-line overlay on hero. Terminal-style cursor in the hero tagline.

---

### VERSION 2 — "Editorial Minimal"
*Clean, high-contrast, magazine-quality. Confident silence.*

- **Background**: Pure white `#ffffff`
- **Surface**: Light grey `#f5f5f3`
- **Accent**: Deep forest green `#1a3c2a`
- **Text**: Near-black `#111111`, muted `#888`
- **Fonts**: `Fraunces` (display headings — optical size, high contrast) + `Instrument Sans` (body)
- **Personality**: Massive typography. Huge section numbers (01, 02, 03) as decorative elements. Generous white space. Thin borders, no shadows.
- **Animations**: Slow, deliberate reveals. Text slides up from below mask. No bounciness — everything feels intentional.
- **Special**: Section numbers in oversized light grey behind headings. Horizontal rule dividers between sections.

---

### VERSION 3 — "Warm Brutalist"
*Bold, asymmetric, unexpected. Not what you expect from a frontend dev.*

- **Background**: Warm cream `#f5f0e8`
- **Surface**: `#ede8dc`
- **Accent**: Burnt orange `#c4541a` with dark navy `#0d1b2a` as secondary
- **Text**: Dark charcoal `#1a1a1a`, muted `#6b5c4a`
- **Fonts**: `Bebas Neue` (display) + `Lora` (body — serif gives warmth)
- **Personality**: Grid-breaking layouts. Some elements bleed off-screen. Bold thick borders (4–6px). Elements slightly overlapping. Hand-crafted feel.
- **Animations**: Slide-in from unexpected directions (right, bottom). Bold scale entrances. Hover states rotate or skew elements slightly.
- **Special**: Section dividers are thick diagonal lines. Cards have thick black borders and offset shadows (neo-brutalist box-shadow).

---

### VERSION 4 — "Soft Glass"
*Modern, polished, premium. Think Vercel meets Linear.*

- **Background**: Deep blue-grey `#0f1117`
- **Surface**: `#161b27` with `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` glass cards
- **Accent**: Electric blue `#4f9cf9` with subtle purple gradient `#7c5cbf`
- **Text**: White `#ffffff`, muted `#8892b0`
- **Fonts**: `Clash Display` (headings) + `Plus Jakarta Sans` (body)
- **Personality**: Frosted glass cards with `backdrop-filter: blur`. Gradient accents. Smooth, almost liquid transitions. Premium and contemporary.
- **Animations**: Fluid, eased. Cards float in on scroll. Glow effects on hover. Gradient text on key words.
- **Special**: Subtle noise texture overlay on glass cards. Radial gradient glow behind hero name. Thin gradient borders on cards.

---

### VERSION 5 — "Bold Nature"
*Earthy, grounded, human. Matches the CV's existing green brand identity.*

- **Background**: Deep forest `#0e1810`
- **Surface**: `#152318`
- **Accent**: Vivid green `#4caf6e` — exact match to the CV
- **Text**: Warm white `#f0f5f1`, muted `#6b8c72`
- **Fonts**: `Syne` (headings — geometric, confident) + `DM Sans` (body — clean, approachable)
- **Personality**: Organic but structured. Feels like the CV brought to life. Confident and warm at the same time. This is the "safe" option that creates the strongest brand consistency.
- **Animations**: Smooth, natural. Elements grow/reveal like plants. Gentle fade-ups. Nothing aggressive.
- **Special**: Subtle leaf/organic shape decorative SVGs as background elements. Green gradient glow on hero. Tech badges styled exactly like CV's tag chips.

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MODEL

1. Scaffold all routes using TanStack Router conventions (`/apps/web/src/routes/`)
2. Build all 7 sections with real content (not Lorem Ipsum)
3. Implement all 5 theme versions as CSS variable classes: `theme-terminal`, `theme-editorial`, `theme-brutalist`, `theme-glass`, `theme-nature`
4. Add a theme switcher component accessible from all 5 version pages
5. GitHub Activity section must make real live API calls — no mocked data
6. All animations must use Framer Motion
7. Mobile responsive at all breakpoints
8. Leave `// TODO` comments wherever content needs to be swapped in (photos, real project links, form endpoint)
9. Do not use placeholder libraries like Lorem Ipsum — use the real copy provided above

**TanStack Router specifics:**
- Use `createRootRoute`, `createRoute`, etc. from `@tanstack/react-router`
- Leverage the existing `routeTree.gen.ts` structure
- Use route loaders for GitHub data fetching where appropriate
- Follow the existing file-based routing pattern
