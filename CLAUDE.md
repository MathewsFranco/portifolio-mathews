# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run dev              # Start all apps in dev mode (Turborepo)
bun run dev:web          # Start web app only (http://localhost:3001)
bun run build            # Build all apps
bun run check            # Lint & format with Biome (auto-fix)
bun run check-types      # TypeScript type checking across all apps
```

## Architecture

**Monorepo** managed by Bun workspaces + Turborepo:

- `apps/web/` — React 19 portfolio SPA (the main application)
- `packages/config/` — Shared TypeScript base config
- `packages/env/` — Environment variable validation (T3 Env + Zod)

### Web App (`apps/web/`)

**Routing:** TanStack Router with file-based routing in `src/routes/`. The route tree is auto-generated by `@tanstack/router-plugin` into `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (excluded from linting).

**Feature structure:**
- `src/features/portfolio/` — Portfolio page, section blocks, shader background
- `src/hooks/` — Custom hooks (GitHub data fetching, count-up animation)
- `src/lib/` — GitHub API client, static portfolio content
- `src/components/` — Shared reusable components

**Path alias:** `@` maps to `apps/web/src` (configured in both Vite and tsconfig).

**3D background:** Uses `@shadergradient/react` with React Three Fiber / Three.js for the animated shader gradient.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS custom properties for theming. Fonts: Fraunces (serif) + Instrument Sans. shadcn/ui components available via `components.json` (style: `base-lyra`, icons: Lucide).

## Code Style

- **Formatter:** Biome with tabs, double quotes for JS/TS
- **Linting:** Biome recommended rules + Tailwind class sorting via `useSortedClasses` (applies to `clsx`, `cva`, `cn` calls)
- **Imports:** Auto-organized by Biome
- Run `bun run check` before committing to ensure compliance
